22,newsletter@em.geekmailz.com,I,R,Property purchased need not be disclosed in income tax return,"Property purchased need not be disclosed in income tax return
As the last date for filing income tax returns draws nearer, there are numerous queries of taxpayeRs.  One such query is whether it’s a good idea to declare a recent purchase of property in the Income Tax Return (ITR). Firstly, for those living under a rock, taxpayers who are yet to file their ITR for the financial year 2019-20 (the assessment year 2020-21), will have to do it by December 31, 2020. Financial Year (FY), the period between 1 April and 31 March, is the year in which one earns an income whereas assessment year (AY) is the year that comes after the FY. During AY, the income earned between FY is assessed and taxed. So, FY 2019-20 and AY 2020-21 are the same. The I-T department earlier extended the due date for filing the ITR, to give relief to taxpayers because of the coronavirus pandemic. Individual taxpayers have until the end of this year to file their return of income, earned between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, instead of November 30. Normally, the due date for filing ITRs for all assessees whose accounts are not required to be audited is July 31."

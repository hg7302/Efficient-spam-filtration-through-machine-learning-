# Efficient-spam-filtration-through-machine-learning-
Implemented efficient spam  filtration over the mails and message    Used the Naive Bayes classifier to determine the spam mail or relevant mail Improving it based on profile and user interest,increasing the accuracy of spam filtration.Our solution would work on the below - 1. Increasing the efficiency of spam filtration using Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm. 2. Categorization of mails on basis of User profile and User interest to  enhance user experience. 3. Detection of mails that have some data / content which may be used to  make a fraud. 4. Update the algorithm on the basis on usefulness / user profile (this is a  part of Algorithm maintenance)
